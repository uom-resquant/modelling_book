# Preface {-}

This is the main text you will be using during the labs for the module *Modelling Criminological Data*. Every week you will have to use these materials during the lab sessions. The idea is that you read this book and try to run the code we provide in your own machine. Along the way you will see you have to complete a series of exercises to check that you are correctly understanding the materials that we introduce. We hope you find these materials useful. They are a work in process, so please if you have any suggestions please don't hesitate to get in touch by submitting an issue to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maczokni/modelling_book) or via email on reka.solymosi@manchester.ac.uk.
