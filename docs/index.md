This study material is designed to introduce Criminology students at the University of Manchester to the use of data science in crime research and practice. This is an improved version originally developed by Juanjo Medina and Reka Solymosi, and is currently being updated and maintained by Ana Nicoriciu - anamaria.nicoriciu@manchester.ac.uk and Sam Langton - samuel.langton@manchester.ac.uk.

**Note for students**<br>
* While this material briefly covers some concepts, students are expected to engage in weekly reading, attend lab sessions, and participate in lectures for a comprehensive course experience. These notes are not intended to be a stand-alone reference or textbook but rather a set of exercises to gain hands-on practice with the concepts introduced during the course. <br>
* This material is designed for Criminology students at the University of Manchester. They are meant to introduce students to descriptive statistics and the key concepts needed to understand quantitative data analysis in crime research. <br>
* The handouts utilise various datasets, including data from the UK Data Service, such as the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is available under an Open Government Licence. These datasets are designed to serve as a learning resource and should not be used for research or the production of summary statistics.
